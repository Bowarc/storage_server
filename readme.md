Compressed Delivery Network :D

## Notes
Idk if any security is needed (ouside something against ddos or spam but i wont do that here)
About file size, we rly should set a limit, even like a rly high one, but a limit is needed

Store different infos in the json ?
Maybe use ron instead of json


## Status
Paused for now as it was a porject for work but i don't need it for now


## Roadmap
- [ ] CDN
    - [x] Web server that we can upload files to
    - [ ] Web server that we can download files from
    - [ ] Save files in a good format(prob json) and save its metadata (name, file ext, image size)
