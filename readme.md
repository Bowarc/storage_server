Compressed Delivery Network :D

Im new to web and all of this so don't expect it to be clean

Idk if any security is needed (ouside something against ddos or spam but i wont do that here)

Do we only save image file ?

Idk how to handle different file types for now
Idk if we sould accept text / binary / audio / video

Maybe handle them differently ?
Store different infos in the json ?

About file size, we rly should set a limit, even like a rly high one, but a limit is needed

## Roadmap
- [ ] CDN
    - [x] Web server that we can upload files to
    - [ ] Web server that we can download files from
    - [ ] Save files in a good format(prob json) and save its metadata (name, file ext, image size)
- [ ] Compression
    - [ ] Compress any file type
